# The-ML-Kickstart
This repository contains my assignment submissions and theory notes from the ACA Summer Project on Machine Learning.
During this project, I gained hands-on experience with data handling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including cleaning data, visualizing patterns, and understanding feature relationships.

I learned the basics of supervised learning and model evaluation by implementing:

Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

Train–test split

Performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and RMSE

I also built and trained a simple neural network from scratch, which helped me understand deep learning fundamentals.
This included:

One hidden layer with tanh activation

Softmax output layer

Training using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Tracking and plotting training vs test loss and accuracy over epochs

As part of this, I trained a neural network classifier on the Iris dataset and visualized its learning behavior.

Overall, this project helped me build a strong foundation in machine learning concepts, model evaluation, and practical implementation.
